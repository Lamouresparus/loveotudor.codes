description: Object-Oriented Programming was this Programming paradigm that I
  found difficult—coming from a QBASIC foundation. I had to do a lot of
  studying, googling, reading tons of articles—which vaguely made sense to me
  then, until I finally got my eureka moment. Here I am, writing an article on
  the concept that took me so long to understand. I can’t still believe I spent
  months on something I could have learned within an hour if I had the proper
  guide. Lol—google search no more, because here I am with the guide I wish I
  had to understand the concept of Object-Oriented Programming.
