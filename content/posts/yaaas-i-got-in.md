### **Hello World 😊**

Okay, so the term ***gist*** is a Nigerian slag which means to engage in a chat😊😊😊.

### **Who am I?**

Holla 🌻. I am Love Otudor(she/her), an android developer and technical writer. I am an Outreachy - Fall 2021 intern for ODK-X. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Uyo, Nigeria. My interests are in Sofware Engineering, Community Building, User Interface & Experience, Open Source Contribution, and Writing.

I have been accepted for The December 2021 to March 2022 Outreachy Internship round. During this period, I will be updating ODK-X’s Tests to the most recent Android Testing Framework. This means that I will be working to ensure ODK-X’s Tests meet the current best practices and take advantage of the new features in Android Testing Frameworks. I will be doing this under the guidance of my mentors: Phebe Temenu, Waylon Brunette, and Caroline Krafft. I am hoping to make some noteworthy contributions to ODK-X.

### **More about me🙈**

Apart from all of the above information, Love Otudor loves singing(She is a great singer too 😊). I love DIYs, trying out new recipes, reading books, and traveling. I love writing too and love spending time with the people I love(I mean, who doesn't love that ❤️). I can't believe I forgot this one😂 I love love love sweet fragrance, whether its a room, a person, a piece of furniture, lol. I am always very particular about how things smell.

I took my first step in learning how to swim yesterday 😂(how it went is a gist for another day) and I hope to learn how to ride a bicycle before the end of this series. Not to worry, I will keep you updated on all these 😂. I can ride a tricycle though 🙈(I know it's kinda embarrassing and for kids).

And Yess! I love to-do's and alarms 😂. I typically set an alarm for every timely event or task.

Oh well, I guess I will have to stop here, at least for now 😁. Cheers!

### **Let’s talk about my core values 🤔:**

This one is a bit tough. Not because I am unsure at any point about my core values, but rather figuring out my top inline core values which build the foundation of my character:

#### **Growth:**

I believe that continuous growth is possible. I want to be a better person, I want to make a place, thing, person, etc better than I met it. I believe that every drop of effort can make a lasting change. Here is a quote I will love to share with you from a book I read by Jordan B. Peterson:

*"But winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning. Should victory in the present always take precedence over trajectory across time?* "

#### **Love:**

I believe that everyone is worth loving. I believe that everyone deserves care and compassion. I want everyone I come across to feel loved and important. I believe Love is the greatest and conquers all. It is an honor to be called Love.

#### **Faith:**

I have faith in God, I have faith in myself, I have faith in other people, and I have faith in the future.



**YES, I MADE IT 🎉🎉🎉.  I am here now as an ODK-X Intern in Outreachy 😊**
